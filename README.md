# Biocomputing-II
This directory contains the code for the CGI scripts.

It imports the blapi.py module from the ../bl directory.

There would be a cgi2 directory if there is an alternative front end.

Reflective Essay

Approach to the project

Interaction with the team I am apart of group 6. My group consists of four members including myself namely, Kyvi, Laura and Fran. My group mates and I had weekly zoom meetings to discuss progress made and discuss different approaches necessary to support eachother. We also had a whatsapp group and an email thread for more frequent updates on any progress made or challenges encountered during the other days of the week. Over all I would say interaction with the team was beneficial and insighting.

Overall project requirements We discussed the requirements stated on the Biocomputing web page. We thereafter had a break down to determine what each layer needed to function. We were able to establish these requirements and make them clearer with every meeting we had. Any revelation each group member would have was immediately shared. As a group we established that a relational sql database needed to be created and populated. The database access tier was meant to allow the business layer acquire information from the sql database. This information was meant to be formatted appropriately for the front end web page to acquire and display.

Requirements for my contribution I was the fourth member of the group that had the option of choosing either on of the stated roles. I chose to go with the alternative front end web design. I discussed my choice with my team mates that were indeed supportive. On a personal basis, I went through the Biocomputing lectures and practicals to remind myself of the necessary format for creation of a web page. I also used web resources to in form of short tutorials and examples on creation of cgi scripts and html web forms. Some of the websites utilised are as follows; https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html.html , https://pythonexamples.org/pandas-render-dataframe-as-html-table/ , https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_examples.asp From the weekly meeting and reviewing of the project guidelines, I was able to establish that I needed html scripts and cgi scripts. The search.py/search.cgi is the cgi script that is meant to return a results page of a specific gene identifier/protein product/accession identifier/gene location that was input in the search box of the html page. The listall.py/listall.cgi is the cgi script that is meant to return the summary table consisting of all the gene identifiers and the necessary information available in the database. The html scripts generally the format in which the front end appears.

Performance of the development cycle The general performance overall was good. There was good communication amongst the four of us. The collaboration was productive and motivating as well. The project was heavy for us all, I commend my group members for being always willing to try and make things better whilst helping eachother. I also commend Racheal Alcraft that assisted my team and I on insights or mistakes made within our code that could make it work better. Racheal gave me advise on how to better review my python code to avoid unnecessary errors whilst creating the cgi scripts.

The development process The development process was gradual and very insighting. Good programmers arenâ€™t made in one day, but with gradual progress regular practice and efficient communication. Programming skills are able to develop this way.

Code testing The html pages were frequently tested as I was working on the server whilst creating them. We were also able to test the code at the end to ensure the different layers were communicating to eachother efficiently.

Known issues There were no known issues in my group. Although I encountered issues such as the 500 Internal server error. I was only able to solve the issues by working with specific functions at a time from the business layer. Below are the links to all web pages generated; http://student.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/~nm001/group6_mn1.html http://student.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/~nm001/group6_mn2.html http://student.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/nm001/search_mn.cgi http://student.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/nm001/listall_mn.cgi

What worked and what didn't - problems and solutions Unfortunately, we were only able to get the lista all cgi script to produce a summary table with 2009 entries. The search function did not work out well as we only got unorganised output.

Alternative strategies Alternatively, I believe if we had more time we might have accomplished the set goal.

Personal insights It has been a productive experience that has improved my programming skills, communication skills and collaboration skills.
